AI DEBUGGING REPORT FOR RUTOS STARLINK FAILOVER SCRIPTS
======================================================

COPY THIS ENTIRE SECTION TO AI FOR DEBUGGING ASSISTANCE:

## Test Summary
- Date: Sat Jul 26 15:56:49 CEST 2025
- Script Version: 2.7.0
- Total Scripts Tested: 73
- Passed: 73
- Failed: 00
- Missing Dry-Run Support: 1
- Success Rate: 100%

## Dry-Run Support Analysis
⚠️  WARNING: 1 scripts lack dry-run support
These scripts cannot be safely tested without making real system changes.
See detailed recommendations below for adding dry-run support.

## Project Context
- Environment: RUTX50 router with busybox shell (POSIX sh only)
- Requirement: All scripts must work in RUTOS/busybox environment
- Test Mode: All scripts run with DRY_RUN=1 and RUTOS_TEST_MODE=1

## Detailed Errors Found
DRY-RUN MISSING in debug-config-rutos.sh:
  Issue: Script lacks dry-run/test mode support
  Impact: Cannot be safely tested without making real changes
  
  Fix: Add this pattern after script setup (after colors/logging functions):
  
  # Dry-run and test mode support
  DRY_RUN="${DRY_RUN:-0}"
  RUTOS_TEST_MODE="${RUTOS_TEST_MODE:-0}"
  
  # Debug dry-run status
  if [ "$DEBUG" = "1" ]; then
      log_debug "DRY_RUN=$DRY_RUN, RUTOS_TEST_MODE=$RUTOS_TEST_MODE"
  fi
  
  # Function to safely execute commands
  safe_execute() {
      cmd="$1"
      description="$2"
      
      if [ "$DRY_RUN" = "1" ] || [ "$RUTOS_TEST_MODE" = "1" ]; then
          log_info "[DRY-RUN] Would execute: $description"
          log_debug "[DRY-RUN] Command: $cmd"
          return 0
      else
          log_debug "Executing: $cmd"
          eval "$cmd"
      fi
  }
  
  Then replace dangerous commands like:
  - cp file1 file2              → safe_execute "cp file1 file2" "Copy file1 to file2"
  - rm -f file                  → safe_execute "rm -f file" "Remove file"
  - /etc/init.d/service restart → safe_execute "/etc/init.d/service restart" "Restart service"
  - crontab -l | ...            → safe_execute "crontab commands" "Update crontab"
  
  Reason: Allows safe testing without making system changes
  

## Script Testing Environment
- Working Directory: /mnt/c/GitHub/rutos-starlink-failover
- Shell: /usr/bin/dash
- Test Date: Sat Jul 26 15:56:49 CEST 2025

## Instructions for AI
1. Analyze each error listed above
2. Focus on RUTOS/busybox compatibility issues
3. Provide specific fixes for each issue
4. Ensure all solutions are POSIX sh compatible
5. For scripts missing dry-run support, implement the recommended pattern
6. Check for common RUTOS pitfalls:
   - bash-specific syntax ([[]], local, echo with -e flag)
   - Missing dependencies or commands
   - Incorrect file paths or permissions
   - Shell compatibility issues
   - Missing dry-run/test mode functionality

## Dry-Run Implementation Priority
Scripts lacking dry-run support should be updated first as they:
- Cannot be safely tested without making real system changes
- Risk causing issues during development and testing
- Should follow the provided safe_execute() pattern for all system operations

## Fix Format Requested
For each error, please provide:
- File: [filename]
- Issue: [description of problem]  
- Fix: [specific code change needed]
- Reason: [why this fix works in RUTOS environment]
