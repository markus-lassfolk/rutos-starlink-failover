AI DEBUGGING REPORT FOR RUTOS STARLINK FAILOVER SCRIPTS
======================================================

COPY THIS ENTIRE SECTION TO AI FOR DEBUGGING ASSISTANCE:

## Test Summary
- Date: Fri Jul 25 22:18:38 CEST 2025
- Script Version: 2.7.0
- Total Scripts Tested: 71
- Passed: 71
- Failed: 00
- Missing Dry-Run Support: 0
- Success Rate: 100%

## Dry-Run Support Analysis
âœ… All scripts have proper dry-run support

## Project Context
- Environment: RUTX50 router with busybox shell (POSIX sh only)
- Requirement: All scripts must work in RUTOS/busybox environment
- Test Mode: All scripts run with DRY_RUN=1 and RUTOS_TEST_MODE=1

## Detailed Errors Found
No errors found - all scripts passed testing!

## Script Testing Environment
- Working Directory: /mnt/c/GitHub/rutos-starlink-failover
- Shell: /usr/bin/dash
- Test Date: Fri Jul 25 22:18:38 CEST 2025

## Instructions for AI
1. Analyze each error listed above
2. Focus on RUTOS/busybox compatibility issues
3. Provide specific fixes for each issue
4. Ensure all solutions are POSIX sh compatible
5. For scripts missing dry-run support, implement the recommended pattern
6. Check for common RUTOS pitfalls:
   - bash-specific syntax ([[]], local, echo with -e flag)
   - Missing dependencies or commands
   - Incorrect file paths or permissions
   - Shell compatibility issues
   - Missing dry-run/test mode functionality

## Dry-Run Implementation Priority
Scripts lacking dry-run support should be updated first as they:
- Cannot be safely tested without making real system changes
- Risk causing issues during development and testing
- Should follow the provided safe_execute() pattern for all system operations

## Fix Format Requested
For each error, please provide:
- File: [filename]
- Issue: [description of problem]  
- Fix: [specific code change needed]
- Reason: [why this fix works in RUTOS environment]
