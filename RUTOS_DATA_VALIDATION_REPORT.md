### **Advanced Threshold Strategy**

For enhanced reliability in mobile environments, consider implementing **tiered thresholds**:

```bash
# Recommended Production Thresholds (Enhanced)
OBSTRUCTION_THRESHOLD=0.001    # 0.1% - current (working well)
OBSTRUCTION_CRITICAL=0.005     # 0.5% - immediate failover

PACKET_LOSS_THRESHOLD=0.03     # 3% - moderate tolerance for satellite
PACKET_LOSS_CRITICAL=0.08      # 8% - immediate failover

LATENCY_THRESHOLD_MS=150       # Current (working well)
LATENCY_CRITICAL_MS=300        # Immediate failover for unusable connections

STABILITY_CHECKS_REQUIRED=5    # 5 good checks before failback (current appears optimal)
```
