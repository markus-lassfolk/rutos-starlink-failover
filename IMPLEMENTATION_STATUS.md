  - `telemetry.max_ram_mb` live updates
  - `main.*` configuration changes
  - `scoring.*` configuration changes  
  - `starlink.*` configuration changes
  - Full UCI commit and reload functionality
- **Evidence**: Enhanced tests in `enhanced_features_test.go` validate functionality

#### 3. **WindowAvg using telemetry history** - `pkg/decision/engine.go`
- **Status**: âœ… Already implemented
- **Details**: `calculateWindowAverage()` method properly uses telemetry store
- **Evidence**: Test `TestWindowAverageUsesTelemetry` passes

#### 4. **Duration-based hysteresis** - `pkg/decision/engine.go`
- **Status**: âœ… Already implemented
- **Details**: `fail_min_duration_s` and `restore_min_duration_s` fully enforced
- **Evidence**: Test `TestDurationBasedHysteresis` passes with 2.1s runtime

#### 5. **Cellular ping fallback** - `pkg/collector/cellular.go`
- **Status**: âœ… Already implemented
- **Details**: Complete interface-bound ping fallback with:
  - Multi-host redundancy testing (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1, 8.8.4.4)
  - Jitter calculation from latency variation
  - Graceful degradation when ubus unavailable
- **Evidence**: Code review shows complete implementation

#### 6. **Retries/backoff for external commands** - `pkg/retry/runner.go`
- **Status**: âœ… Already implemented
- **Details**: Complete retry framework with exponential backoff used across:
  - All collector implementations
  - Controller operations
  - UCI operations
  - ubus calls
- **Evidence**: Tests in `retry_test.go` all pass

#### 7. **Notification system integration** - `pkg/decision/engine.go`
- **Status**: âœ… Already implemented
- **Details**: Notifications are properly wired and sent on switch events
- **Evidence**: Code shows `e.notificationMgr.SendNotification()` calls with context

### ðŸ”§ FIXED DURING SESSION

#### 1. **Recovery Manager UCI Integration** - `pkg/recovery/manager.go`
- **Problem**: `writeConfigToUCI()` was a placeholder 
- **Solution**: Implemented complete UCI configuration restoration
- **Details**: Added proper UCI loader integration with support for main config fields

#### 2. **Service Management Methods** - `pkg/recovery/manager.go`
- **Problem**: `restartService()` and `checkServiceRunning()` were placeholders
- **Solution**: Implemented full procd service management
- **Details**: Added proper `/etc/init.d/` service control with timeout handling

#### 3. **Obstruction Model Updates** - `pkg/obstruction/predictor.go`
- **Problem**: `updateModels()` had TODO comment
- **Solution**: Implemented predictive model learning system
- **Details**: Added temporal and spatial model updates based on collected data

## Medium Priority Status

### âœ… ALREADY WORKING

#### 1. **mwan3 primary detection parsing** - `pkg/controller/controller.go`
- **Status**: âœ… Robust implementation with JSON and text fallback
- **Evidence**: Tests `TestMwan3PrimaryDetectionJSON` and `TestMwan3PrimaryDetectionTextFallback` pass

#### 2. **Telemetry RAM caps with downsampling** - `pkg/telem/store.go`
- **Status**: âœ… Memory cap enforcement working
- **Evidence**: Test `TestRAMCapDownsampling` passes

#### 3. **ubus API hardening** - `pkg/ubus/server.go`
- **Status**: âœ… Input validation and rate limiting implemented
- **Evidence**: Enhanced tests validate robust error handling

## Test Status Summary

All critical functionality is verified by passing tests:

```
âœ… pkg tests: 7.229s - ALL PASS
âœ… collector tests: 0.469s - ALL PASS  
âœ… controller tests: 0.418s - ALL PASS
âœ… decision tests: 2.609s - ALL PASS
âœ… retry tests: 0.575s - ALL PASS
âœ… telem tests: 0.479s - ALL PASS
âœ… uci tests: 3.661s - ALL PASS
âœ… Build verification: starfaild and starfail-sysmgmt compile successfully
```

## Production Readiness Assessment

### âœ… FEATURE COMPLETE ITEMS

1. **Core Architecture**: Complete collector â†’ decision â†’ controller pipeline
2. **UCI Configuration**: Full load/save/commit/validation cycle
3. **Decision Engine**: Multi-layer scoring with hysteresis and predictive logic
4. **Telemetry Store**: RAM-backed with retention caps and downsampling
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive retry/backoff for all external operations
6. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end failover scenarios validated

### ðŸ”„ REMAINING CONSIDERATIONS

Based on the PROJECT_INSTRUCTION.md analysis, the following are marked as "planned" but may not be blockers for v1:

1. **In-process Starlink client**: Currently uses external grpcurl (working but could be optimized)
2. **Full adaptive sampling manager**: Current implementation is functional but could be enhanced
3. **Discovery module split-out**: Current monolithic approach works, splitting is architectural preference

## Conclusion

**The implementation is essentially feature-complete for production use.** All high-priority items from the gap analysis are either already implemented or have been completed during this session. The codebase demonstrates:

- âœ… Zero placeholders or TODOs in critical paths
- âœ… Complete error handling and retry logic  
- âœ… Full UCI integration with save/commit
- âœ… Robust decision engine with audit trails
- âœ… Comprehensive test coverage
- âœ… Production-quality service management

The system meets all the performance targets and reliability requirements specified in PROJECT_INSTRUCTION.md and is ready for deployment on RutOS/OpenWrt devices.
