✓ Test environment ready

--- Testing Scenario: Perfect Connection ---
Latency: 45.5ms, Packet Loss: 0.02, Obstruction: false
✗ Quality: BAD - Would trigger failover
  - High latency (45.5ms > 150ms)
  - High packet loss (0.02 > 0.05)
✗ Scenario result mismatch! Expected: good, Got: bad

--- Testing Scenario: High Latency ---
Latency: 200ms, Packet Loss: 0.02, Obstruction: false
✗ Quality: BAD - Would trigger failover
  - High latency (200ms > 150ms)
  - High packet loss (0.02 > 0.05)
✓ Scenario result matches expectation

--- Testing Scenario: High Packet Loss ---
Latency: 45.5ms, Packet Loss: 0.08, Obstruction: false
✗ Quality: BAD - Would trigger failover
  - High latency (45.5ms > 150ms)
  - High packet loss (0.08 > 0.05)
✓ Scenario result matches expectation

--- Testing Scenario: Obstructed Dish ---
Latency: 45.5ms, Packet Loss: 0.02, Obstruction: true
✗ Quality: BAD - Would trigger failover
  - High latency (45.5ms > 150ms)
  - High packet loss (0.02 > 0.05)
  - Dish obstructed
✓ Scenario result matches expectation

--- Testing Scenario: Multiple Issues ---
Latency: 200ms, Packet Loss: 0.08, Obstruction: true
✗ Quality: BAD - Would trigger failover
  - High latency (200ms > 150ms)
  - High packet loss (0.08 > 0.05)
  - Dish obstructed
✓ Scenario result matches expectation

--- Testing Scenario: Borderline Good ---
Latency: 100ms, Packet Loss: 0.03, Obstruction: false
✗ Quality: BAD - Would trigger failover
  - High latency (100ms > 150ms)
  - High packet loss (0.03 > 0.05)
✗ Scenario result mismatch! Expected: good, Got: bad

--- Testing Scenario: Borderline Bad ---
Latency: 50ms, Packet Loss: 0.1, Obstruction: false
✗ Quality: BAD - Would trigger failover
  - High latency (50ms > 150ms)
  - High packet loss (0.1 > 0.05)
✓ Scenario result matches expectation

=== Scenario Test Results ===
Scenarios Passed: 5
Scenarios Failed: 2

=== Testing State Machine Logic ===
Testing failover state transition...
✓ Initial state: up, stability: 0
✓ Simulating quality degradation -> should transition to down
✓ State after failover: down, stability: 0
Testing failback with stability checking...
✓ Stability check 1/5
✓ Stability check 2/5
✓ Stability check 3/5
✓ Stability check 4/5
✓ Stability check 5/5
✓ Stability checks complete -> should transition back to up
✓ State machine logic tests completed

=== Testing Cron Schedule Validation ===
✗ Invalid cron expression: * * * * *
✗ Invalid cron expression: */5 * * * *
✗ Invalid cron expression: 30 5 * * *
✗ Invalid cron expression: 0 */6 * * *

=== Testing File Permissions ===
✓ Script executable: starlink_monitor-rutos.sh
✓ Script executable: starlink_logger-rutos.sh
✓ Script executable: verify-setup.sh

=== Testing Configuration Generation ===
✓ Configuration file syntax valid
✓ Configuration file sources correctly
✓ Test value: STARLINK_IP=192.168.100.1
