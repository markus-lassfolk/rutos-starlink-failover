## Testing the Enhanced System

The enhanced health check system can be tested on RUTOS with:

```bash
# Test script execution capabilities
./scripts/health-check-rutos.sh --full

# Test system log monitoring
./scripts/health-check-rutos.sh --monitoring

# Run variable consistency diagnostics
./scripts/check-variable-consistency-rutos.sh

# Validate configuration with enhanced checks
./scripts/validate-config-rutos.sh
```

## Validation Status
