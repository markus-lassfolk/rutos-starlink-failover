# Issue Analysis: validate-config.sh Not Downloaded

**Version:** 2.6.0 | **Updated:** 2025-07-24

## Problem Report

```text
/root/starlink-monitor/scripts/validate-config.sh
-ash: /root/starlink-monitor/scripts/validate-config.sh: not found
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues Found

1. **Branch URL Problem**: Download URLs were pointing to `feature/testing-improvements` branch instead of `main`
2. **Shell Compatibility**: `validate-config.sh` was using bash-specific features incompatible with RUTOS
3. **Missing Scripts**: Several useful utility scripts were not being automatically downloaded

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Download URLs

**Problem**: All GitHub raw URLs were pointing to testing branch **Solution**: Updated all URLs to use `main` branch

```bash
# Before (broken):
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markus-lassfolk/rutos-starlink-failover/feature/testing-improvements/scripts/validate-config.sh

# After (working):
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markus-lassfolk/rutos-starlink-failover/main/scripts/validate-config.sh
```

### 2. RUTOS Shell Compatibility

**Problem**: `validate-config.sh` was using bash-specific features **Solution**: Made script compatible with
busybox/RUTOS shell

```bash
# Before (bash-specific):
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# After (POSIX-compatible):
#!/bin/sh
set -eu
```

### 3. Added Utility Scripts

**Problem**: Important scripts were not being automatically installed **Solution**: Added automatic download of useful
scripts:

- `uci-optimizer.sh` - Optimizes RUTOS configuration
- `check_starlink_api_change.sh` - Monitors API changes
- `self-update.sh` - Self-update functionality

### 4. Enhanced Download Function

**Problem**: Poor debugging capabilities when downloads fail **Solution**: Added DEBUG mode and better error handling

```bash
# Usage:
DEBUG=1 curl -fL <install_url> | sh
```

### 5. Better Error Messages

**Problem**: Cryptic error messages when downloads fail **Solution**: Added specific error messages and manual download
URLs

## Testing Instructions

### Test Fixed Installation

```bash
# Normal installation
curl -fL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markus-lassfolk/rutos-starlink-failover/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
