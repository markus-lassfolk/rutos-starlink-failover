- **Automated Quality**: Pre-commit validation system implemented
- **Repository Organized**: Clean structure with dedicated test directory
- **4-Level Logging**: Enhanced debugging with standardized framework
- **Validation Coverage**: 50+ compatibility checks implemented

## Core Features Operational

### ✅ RUTOS Library System
- Complete 4-module framework with auto-loading
- Standardized logging functions eliminate code duplication
- Self-contained with remote download capability

### ✅ 4-Level Logging Framework
- **NORMAL**: Standard operation info
- **DRY_RUN=1**: Safe mode preview without actual changes
- **DEBUG=1**: Detailed debugging information
- **RUTOS_TEST_MODE=1**: Full execution trace logging

### ✅ Remote Installation
- Works via curl on RUTX50 with automatic library download
- Enhanced installation debugging with comprehensive system info
- Smart disk space management with automatic fallback directories
- Pre-download space validation and enhanced error reporting

### ✅ Configuration Management
- Template-based with automatic migration system
- Backup strategy with preservation of user values
- Structure validation separate from content validation

### ✅ Enhanced Debugging
- Command tracing with safe_execute()
- Variable change tracking in trace mode
- Enhanced error reporting with context
- Multi-level debug output for troubleshooting

### ✅ Version Management
- Automatic semantic versioning with git integration
- Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH+GIT_COUNT.GIT_COMMIT[-dirty]`
- All scripts include `SCRIPT_VERSION` variable

### ✅ Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive pre-commit validation system
- ShellCheck compliance for POSIX compatibility
- shfmt integration for code formatting
- Template validation and cleanliness checks

### ✅ RUTOS Compatibility
- Full busybox shell support with Method 5 printf
- POSIX sh compliance validated through testing
- Works on RUTX50 with RUTOS RUT5_R_00.07.09.7

## Current Focus Areas

1. **Library Integration**: Migrate remaining scripts to use RUTOS library system
2. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Unified scripts with full library features
3. **Documentation**: Complete library system documentation
4. **Azure Integration**: Logging and monitoring components with library support

## Recent Improvements (July 2025)

- **Library System**: Complete RUTOS library implementation with 4 modules

- **Enhanced Debugging**: Command tracing and variable tracking
- **Self-Contained Install**: Remote library download capability
- **Code Reduction**: Eliminated duplicate functions across all scripts
- **Modern Tooling**: Integration of shfmt and enhanced validation
- **Enhanced Installation Debugging**: Comprehensive system info, disk space checking, and multi-level tracing
- **Smart Disk Space Management**: Automatic fallback directory selection with proper cleanup
- **Installation Reliability**: Pre-download space validation and enhanced error reporting
- **Troubleshooting Support**: Detailed debugging output with system context

## Production Readiness Status

### ✅ Production Ready Components

- **RUTOS Compatibility**: Full busybox shell support with library
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Library-based comprehensive safety
- **Configuration Management**: Template migration system
