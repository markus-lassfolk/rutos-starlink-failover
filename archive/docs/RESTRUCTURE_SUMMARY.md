**Date**: August 13, 2025  
**Branch**: go-core-claude  
**Status**: Initial Go structure created

## 🎯 Project Transformation

Successfully restructured the repository according to PROJECT_INSTRUCTION.md to support the 
transition from Bash scripts to a Go-based daemon implementation.

## 📁 New Directory Structure

Created the complete Go project structure as specified:

   - Main event loop with 1.5s tick
   - Configuration reloading
   - Structured logging integration

2. **Structured Logging** (`pkg/logx/`)
   - JSON output format for syslog integration
   - Debug/Info/Warn/Error levels
   - Key-value pair support
   - Thread-safe implementation

3. **Collector Framework** (`pkg/collector/`)
   - Interface definitions for metric collection
   - Registry pattern for multiple collector types
   - Support for Starlink, Cellular, WiFi, LAN classes
   - Extensible metrics structure

4. **Decision Engine** (`pkg/decision/`)
   - Score calculation framework (instant, EWMA, window average)
   - Member state tracking with eligibility logic
   - Switch event modeling
   - Hysteresis and cooldown management

5. **Configuration Management** (`pkg/uci/`)
   - Type-safe UCI configuration parsing
   - Default value handling
   - Validation framework
   - Hot-reload support

### Support Infrastructure

1. **CLI Helper** (`scripts/starfailctl`)

- OS-native integration (UCI, ubus, procd, mwan3)
- Abstraction-first design (interfaces for collectors/controllers)
- Autonomous operation with predictive switching
- Resource-friendly (12MB binary, 25MB RAM targets)

### Core Loop ✅
- 1.5s tick interval with member discovery
- Metric collection via provider interfaces  
- Score calculation and decision evaluation
- Controller integration for policy changes
- Telemetry storage and event logging

### Integration Points ✅
- UCI configuration file (`/etc/config/starfail`)
- ubus API service (`starfail` methods)
- mwan3 policy management
- procd service integration
- Hotplug interface monitoring

## 🚀 Ready for Implementation

The repository is now properly structured for Go-based development with:

1. **Clear architecture** following PROJECT_INSTRUCTION.md
2. **Complete build system** for cross-platform compilation
3. **Support infrastructure** (CLI, init, packaging)
4. **Documentation framework** for ongoing development
5. **Preserved legacy** for reference and migration

The foundation is in place to implement the full starfail daemon according to the specification, with all necessary infrastructure for testing, packaging, and deployment on RutOS and OpenWrt platforms.
