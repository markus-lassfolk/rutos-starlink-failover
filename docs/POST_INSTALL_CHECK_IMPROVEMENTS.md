# Post-Install Check Script Improvements

**Version:** 2.6.0 | **Updated:** 2025-07-24

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ **1. Starlink IP Address Testing**

**Problem**: The script was using a basic TCP test that didn't actually verify the gRPC API was responding properly.

**Solution**:

- Enhanced the connectivity test to use proper grpcurl testing like the dedicated connectivity test script
- Uses netcat (nc) for basic TCP connectivity, then grpcurl for proper gRPC API testing
- Provides detailed feedback about what level of connectivity is working
- Moved Starlink tests to their own dedicated section (Section 3)

### ✅ **2. MWAN Member Configuration Check**

**Problem**: The UCI path was incorrect (`mwan3.member.member1` vs `mwan3.member1`) and didn't provide helpful feedback.

**Solution**:

- Fixed UCI path to use correct format: `mwan3.$MWAN_MEMBER`
- Added helpful feedback showing available MWAN members when configured member isn't found
- Shows the interface associated with the found member for verification
- Now correctly detects `member1` as shown in your `uci show mwan3.member1` output

### ✅ **3. Monitoring Thresholds Explanation**

**Problem**: The thresholds were displayed without explaining what they monitor.

**Solution**:

- Added clear descriptions for each threshold:
  - **Check Interval**: How often Starlink connectivity is monitored (seconds)
  - **Connectivity Failure Threshold**: Number of consecutive failures before failover to cellular
  - **Connectivity Recovery Threshold**: Number of consecutive successes before failback to Starlink
- Provides context about what each setting controls

### ✅ **4. Disk Space Check for RUTOS**

**Problem**: The script was alarming about 100% root filesystem usage, which is normal for RUTOS overlay systems.

**Solution**:

- Enhanced disk space checking to recognize RUTOS overlay filesystems
- 100% root filesystem usage is now treated as normal for embedded systems with overlay/tmpfs
- Added checks for separate data partitions that are more relevant (`/mnt/data`, `/opt`, `/var`, `/tmp`)
- Provides more meaningful disk space monitoring for RUTOS environments

### ✅ **5. Removed Duplicate Starlink Test**

**Problem**: Starlink gRPC connectivity was tested twice - once in Network Configuration and once in Connectivity Tests.

**Solution**:

- Consolidated Starlink testing into the dedicated "Starlink Configuration" section (Section 3)
- Removed duplicate test from connectivity section
- Streamlined the overall testing flow

### ✅ **6. Created Missing Scripts**

**Problem**: Quick Actions referenced scripts that didn't exist.

**Solution**: Created the missing scripts:

#### `view-logs-rutos.sh`

- **Purpose**: View and analyze system logs for troubleshooting
- **Features**:
  - View monitoring logs (`--monitor`)
  - View system logs (`--system`)
  - Show error logs only (`--errors`)
  - Show recent logs (`--recent`)
  - Tail logs in real-time (`--tail`)
- **Usage**: `/usr/local/starlink-monitor/scripts/view-logs-rutos.sh [OPTION]`

#### `repair-system-rutos.sh`

- **Purpose**: Automatic system repair for common issues
- **Features**:
  - Repair cron job issues (`--cron`)
  - Fix configuration problems (`--config`)
  - Fix file permissions (`--permissions`)
  - Clean and rotate logs (`--logs`)
  - Fix database issues (`--database`)
  - Run all repairs (`--all`)
- **Usage**: `/usr/local/starlink-monitor/scripts/repair-system-rutos.sh [OPTION]`

### ✅ **7. Improved Section Organization**

**New Section Structure**:

1. **Core System Components** - Installation verification
2. **Cron Scheduling** - Automated task configuration
3. **Starlink Configuration** - Dedicated Starlink testing section
4. **Network Configuration** - MWAN interface and member setup
5. **Notification System** - Pushover/Slack configuration
6. **Monitoring Thresholds** - Connectivity monitoring settings (with explanations)
7. **System Health** - Disk space, memory, logs (RUTOS-aware)
8. **Connectivity Tests** - Internet and DNS connectivity

## Enhanced User Experience

### **Better Error Messages**

- MWAN member issues now show available members for correction
- Starlink connectivity provides detailed failure analysis
- Disk space warnings explain RUTOS behavior

### **Comprehensive Quick Actions**

All referenced scripts now exist and are functional:

```bash
• Configure system:  vi /etc/starlink-config/config.sh
• Re-run validation: /usr/local/starlink-monitor/scripts/validate-config-rutos.sh
• Test monitoring:   /usr/local/starlink-monitor/scripts/test-monitoring-rutos.sh
• Check system:      /usr/local/starlink-monitor/scripts/system-status-rutos.sh
• View logs:         /usr/local/starlink-monitor/scripts/view-logs-rutos.sh
• Repair issues:     /usr/local/starlink-monitor/scripts/repair-system-rutos.sh
```

### **RUTOS Compatibility**

- Recognizes RUTOS overlay filesystem behavior
- Uses proper UCI commands for MWAN3 configuration
- Accounts for embedded system limitations and normal behaviors

## Testing Recommendations

After these improvements, the post-install check should now provide:

1. **Accurate Starlink Testing**: Properly detects gRPC API connectivity
2. **Helpful MWAN Feedback**: Shows available members when misconfigured
3. **Clear Threshold Explanations**: Users understand what each setting controls
4. **RUTOS-Appropriate Disk Monitoring**: No false alarms about overlay filesystems
5. **Functional Quick Actions**: All referenced scripts exist and work
6. **Better Organization**: Starlink tests grouped logically

The script should now provide much more actionable and accurate information for RUTOS users!
