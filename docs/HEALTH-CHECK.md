### Configurable Thresholds
- **CRITICAL**: No logs in 60+ minutes (monitoring likely failed)
- **WARNING**: No logs in 30-60 minutes (monitoring may be delayed)
- **HEALTHY**: Recent logs within 30 minutes

### Log Locations Monitored
- Main monitoring logs
- System logs
- Error logs
- State files

### Custom Thresholds
```bash
# Set custom log freshness threshold (in minutes)
LOG_FRESHNESS_THRESHOLD=45 /root/starlink-monitor/scripts/health-check.sh
```

## System Resource Monitoring

### Disk Space Monitoring
```bash
# Critical: < 1GB free space
# Warning: < 2GB free space
# Healthy: > 2GB free space
```

### Memory Monitoring
```bash
# Critical: > 90% memory usage
# Warning: > 80% memory usage
# Healthy: < 80% memory usage
```

### CPU Load Monitoring
```bash
# Critical: Load > 2.0
# Warning: Load > 1.0
# Healthy: Load < 1.0
```

Integrate with notification system for automated alerts:

```bash
# Health check with notification on critical issues
/root/starlink-monitor/scripts/health-check.sh && echo "Health check passed" || echo "Health check failed - investigate immediately"
```

## Exit Codes

The health check script uses standard exit codes:

- **0**: All checks passed (healthy)
- **1**: Warnings found (investigate)
- **2**: Critical issues found (immediate attention required)
- **3**: No checks performed (configuration error)

### Using Exit Codes in Scripts
```bash
#!/bin/sh
if /root/starlink-monitor/scripts/health-check.sh --quick; then
    echo "System is healthy"
else
    case $? in
        1) echo "System has warnings - investigate when convenient" ;;
        2) echo "System has critical issues - immediate attention required" ;;
        3) echo "Health check failed to run - check configuration" ;;
    esac
fi
```
