- **WARNING**: No logs in 30-60 minutes (monitoring may be delayed)
- **HEALTHY**: Recent logs within 30 minutes

### Log Locations Monitored
- Main monitoring logs
- System logs
- Error logs
- State files

### Custom Thresholds
```bash
# Set custom log freshness threshold (in minutes)
LOG_FRESHNESS_THRESHOLD=45 /root/starlink-monitor/scripts/health-check.sh
```

## System Resource Monitoring

### Disk Space Monitoring
```bash
# Critical: < 1GB free space
# Warning: < 2GB free space
# Healthy: > 2GB free space
```

### Memory Monitoring
```bash
# Critical: > 90% memory usage
# Warning: > 80% memory usage
# Healthy: < 80% memory usage
```

### CPU Load Monitoring
```bash
# Critical: Load > 2.0
# Warning: Load > 1.0
# Healthy: Load < 1.0
```
