# Testing Progress and Improvements

This document tracks testing progress and improvements for the RUTOS Starlink failover solution.

## Testing Status

### Core Scripts
- [ ] `scripts/uci-optimizer.sh` - Configuration analyzer and optimizer
- [ ] `Starlink-RUTOS-Failover/starlink_monitor.sh` - Main monitoring script
- [ ] `config/config.advanced.template.sh` - Advanced configuration template
- [🔧] `scripts/install.sh` - Installation script *(fixing remote downloads)*
- [ ] `scripts/validate-config.sh` - Configuration validator

### Deployment Scripts
- [ ] `deploy-starlink-solution-rutos.sh` - RUTOS deployment
- [ ] `deploy-starlink-solution.sh` - General deployment
- [ ] `scripts/check_starlink_api_change.sh` - API change checker

### Azure Integration
- [ ] `Starlink-RUTOS-Failover/AzureLogging/` - Azure logging components
- [ ] `Starlink-RUTOS-Failover/AzureLogging/starlink-azure-monitor.sh` - Azure monitor integration

## Known Issues

### ❌ Installation Script Issues
1. **Missing validate-config.sh** - Script not downloaded when using curl installation
   - Install script only copies validate-config.sh if running locally
   - Remote installation via curl doesn't have access to other scripts
   
2. **Missing nano editor** - RUTOS doesn't include nano by default
   - Need to use `vi` instead or check for available editors
   - Should provide guidance on alternative editors

3. **🚨 CRITICAL: Crontab Overwrite Risk** - Installation overwrites existing cron jobs
   - Uses `grep -v "starlink"` which misses entries like `/root/starlink_monitor.sh`
   - Could wipe out important existing cron jobs on production systems
   - Pattern matching too narrow and unsafe

## Improvements Needed

### 🔧 Install Script Fixes
1. **Download validate-config.sh remotely** - Modify install.sh to download all required scripts
2. **Editor detection** - Check for available editors (vi, nano, vim) and guide user
3. **Better error handling** - Graceful handling when optional scripts are missing
4. **🚨 PRIORITY: Safe crontab management** - Comment out old entries instead of deleting them

## Testing Environment
- Router: RUTX50
- RUTOS Version: 
- Starlink Hardware: 
- Cellular Providers: 

## Test Results

### ✅ Live RUTX50 Testing - Round 1
**Date**: July 14, 2025  
**System**: RUTX50 running RUTOS  
**Test Method**: Remote installation via curl

#### Installation Script (`scripts/install.sh`)
**Status**: ✅ Partially Working / 🔧 Fixing Issues

**Successes**:
- ✅ Downloads and runs successfully via curl
- ✅ Creates directory structure correctly
- ✅ Downloads and installs grpcurl (ARMv7)
- ✅ Downloads and installs jq (ARMv7)  
- ✅ Installs main monitoring scripts
- ✅ Configures cron jobs properly
- ✅ Creates uninstall script

**Issues Found**:
- ❌ Missing `validate-config.sh` - script not downloaded during remote installation
- ❌ Missing `nano` editor - RUTOS doesn't include nano by default
- ❌ Config template not downloaded during remote installation
- 🚨 **CRITICAL**: Unsafe crontab management - could wipe existing cron jobs

**Fixes Applied**:
- 🔧 Added remote download logic for `validate-config.sh`
- 🔧 Added remote download logic for config template
- 🔧 Added editor detection and guidance (vi/nano/vim)
- 🔧 Enhanced error handling for missing scripts
- 🚨 **CRITICAL FIX**: Safe crontab management with commenting instead of deletion
  - Changed from deleting entries to commenting them out with timestamps
  - Pattern: `# COMMENTED BY INSTALL SCRIPT 2025-07-14: [original entry]`
  - Users can easily restore with provided sed command if needed
  - Added timestamped backups with user notification
  - Enhanced uninstall script with same safety measures

**Next Test**: Re-test installation after fixes

### ❌ Live RUTX50 Testing - Round 2 
**Date**: July 14, 2025  
**System**: RUTX50 running RUTOS  
**Test Method**: Remote installation via curl from testing branch

#### Installation Script (`scripts/install.sh`) - Round 2
**Status**: ❌ Syntax Error

**Command Used**:
```bash
curl -fL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markus-lassfolk/rutos-starlink-failover/feature/testing-improvements/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

**Error Found**:
```
sh: syntax error: unexpected "fi" (expecting "}")
```

**Root Cause**: AWK script with `strftime()` function not compatible with RUTOS shell
- Used advanced AWK features not available in busybox/RUTOS
- Extended regex syntax `-E` in sed may not be supported

**Fix Applied**: 
- 🔧 Replaced AWK script with basic sed commands
- 🔧 Changed from `sed -E` to basic `sed` with POSIX regex
- 🔧 Simplified pattern matching for better compatibility

**Next Test**: Re-test with portable shell commands

### 🔧 CI/CD Issues Found & Fixed
**Date**: July 14, 2025  
**GitHub Actions Status**: ❌ Multiple workflow failures

#### Issues Found:
1. **Security Check Failure**: 
   - `config/config.advanced.template.sh` had wrong permissions (644 instead of 600)
   
2. **ShellCheck Syntax Errors**:
   - `scripts/install.sh`: Extra `fi` statement in `install_config()` function
   - `scripts/uci-optimizer.sh`: Unused variables causing warnings

#### Fixes Applied:
- 🔧 Fixed file permissions for config.advanced.template.sh
- 🔧 Corrected shell syntax in install_config() function  
- 🔧 Commented out unused variables in uci-optimizer.sh
- 🔧 Fixed variable declaration patterns for ShellCheck compliance

**Status**: Ready for Round 3 testing after CI/CD fixes

### ✅ Git File Mode Enabled (Windows Development)
**Date**: July 14, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Configured for better Linux compatibility

#### Changes Made:
- ✅ Enabled `git config core.filemode true` - Git now tracks executable permissions
- ✅ Disabled `git config core.autocrlf false` - Prevents Windows CRLF line ending issues  
- ✅ Config files properly set to 644 (non-executable) in git index
- ✅ Script files remain 755 (executable) in git index

#### Benefits:
- 🔧 Better cross-platform compatibility  
- 🔧 File permissions properly tracked for Linux deployment
- 🔧 CI/CD security checks will work correctly
- 🔧 Consistent behavior between Windows development and Linux production

#### Note:
- Windows Git can only track executable bit (755 vs 644)
- Actual 600/644 permissions are set by security script on Linux
- This ensures proper permissions in production while allowing Windows development

**Status**: All CI/CD fixes applied - Ready for Round 3 testing

### ❌ Live RUTX50 Testing - Round 4
**Date**: July 14, 2025  
**System**: RUTX50 running RUTOS  
**Test Method**: Remote installation via curl from testing branch

#### Installation Script (`scripts/install.sh`) - Round 4
**Status**: ❌ Shell Compatibility Issues

**Command Used**:
```bash
curl -fL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markus-lassfolk/rutos-starlink-failover/feature/testing-improvements/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

**Errors Found**:
```
sh: : not found
sh: set: line 11: illegal option -o pipefail
curl: (23) Failure writing output to destination, passed 1422 returned 0
```

**Root Causes**: 
1. **Line ending issues**: Windows CRLF line endings causing `: not found` errors
2. **Shell incompatibility**: `set -o pipefail` not supported in busybox shell
3. **Bash vs sh**: Script declared as `#!/bin/bash` but running with `sh`

**Fix Applied**: 
- 🔧 Changed shebang from `#!/bin/bash` to `#!/bin/sh`
- 🔧 Removed `-o pipefail` option (busybox doesn't support it)
- 🔧 Converted line endings from CRLF to LF
- 🔧 Ensured full POSIX shell compatibility

**Next Test**: Re-test with busybox-compatible shell script

### ❌ Live RUTX50 Testing - Round 3
**Date**: July 14, 2025  
**System**: RUTX50 running RUTOS  
**Test Method**: Remote installation via curl from testing branch

#### Installation Script (`scripts/install.sh`) - Round 3
**Status**: ❌ Missing Function Definition

**Command Used**:
```bash
curl -fL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markus-lassfolk/rutos-starlink-failover/feature/testing-improvements/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

**Error Found**:
```
sh: download_file: not found
```

**Root Cause**: Missing `download_file` function definition
- Script calls `download_file` function but function was never defined
- Added remote download logic but forgot to add the actual function
- URLs were pointing to main branch instead of testing branch

**Fix Applied**: 
- 🔧 Added `download_file()` function with wget/curl fallback
- 🔧 Updated all download URLs to use testing branch instead of main
- 🔧 Function includes proper error handling and tool detection

**Next Test**: Re-test with complete download functionality
